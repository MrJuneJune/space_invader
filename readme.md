# Space Invader

## Description

This project is a simple recreation of the classic "Space Invader" game, created as a fun weekend project in just an hour or two. The player controls a spaceship, shoots bullets, and attempts to destroy blocks (or "invaders") before they reach the bottom of the screen. This project was built using the Raylib library.

## Libraries

- **Raylib**  
  A simple and easy-to-use library for games and graphical applications. It provides a wrapper for **OpenGL** for rendering and **GLFW** for managing windows, inputs, and events.

- **CMake**  
  Used for building the project and managing the build process.

- **Make**  
  Used to simplify the build process.

## How to start

1. Clone the repository or download the source files.
2. Ensure you have Raylib and CMake installed on your machine.
3. Run the following commands to build and start the game:

```bash
make
./build/space_invader
```
